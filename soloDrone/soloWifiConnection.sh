# Connecting the solo to a common network or network with internet.
#
# We installed the Solo CLI, we now have more control over the solo network.
#
#
# In order to connect the solo to another network, 
# ensure that you are still connected to the existing solo network (SoloLink-xxx) 
# and run the following code 
# replacing <ssid> with your WAP SSID and <password> with your WAP password:
# solo wifi --name=<ssid> --password=<password>
# 
# example :
#           solo wifi --name=solocommand --password=commandsolo
